### tl;dr

This is a template to get you started with Next.js 13, RSC (React Server Components), Windstitch (Tailwind CSS in React), and Turbopack. It uses colaction to organize your code (see /modules) and uses as much new features from Next.js 13 as possible.

### Next.js 13 with /app

Next.js 13 introduces a new /app directory that is intended to contain all routes as well as meta data, layout definitions, and other colocated files. This is a great way to organize your application and is a big improvement over the previous approach.

### Revalidation of React Components

With Next.js 13, you can now revalidate React (Server) components by simply adding a revalidate property as 2nd argument to the fetch function inside the RSC. Learn more.

#### Windstitch for Tailwind

Windstitch is a library that allows you to use Tailwind classes in your React components. It replaces the need for a CSS-in-JS library like Emotion or Styled Components and is compatible with RSC. Windstitch has a styled-like API and supports polymorphic components.

### Windstitch & VS Code

To improve the DX of Windstitch, this template also includes a custom VS Code settings.json file. This extension allows you to use Tailwind classes in your CSS-in-JS files and provides autocompletion for them. It is not perfect yet, but it is still a great improvement over the default experience.

### Turbopack

Turbopack is a build tool developed by Vercel that is written in Rust. It replaces the need for a bundler like Webpack or Parcel and is extremely fast. You should therefore notice a significant improvement in your build times.

### TypeScript 5

This template also uses TypeScript 5. TypeScript 5 introduces performance improvements, new features (like the satisfies-operator), and bug fixes.

### Demo by Pts.js

Pts.js is a library for creative coding in JavaScript and powers the playful animation in the hero section of this page. Feel free to remove it if you do not need it. But I highly recommend you to check it out.

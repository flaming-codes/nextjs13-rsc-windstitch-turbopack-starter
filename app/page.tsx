            This is a template to get you started with Next.js 13, RSC (React
            Server Components), Windstitch (Tailwind CSS in React), and
            Turbopack. It uses colaction to organize your code (see{" "}
            <code>/modules</code>) and uses as much new features from Next.js 13
            as possible.

            Next.js 13 introduces a new <code>/app</code> directory that is
            intended to contain all routes as well as meta data, layout
            definitions, and other colocated files. This is a great way to
            organize your application and is a big improvement over the previous
            approach.

            With Next.js 13, you can now revalidate React (Server) components by
            simply adding a<code>revalidate</code> property as 2nd argument to
            the <code>fetch</code> function inside the RSC.

            Windstitch is a library that allows you to use Tailwind classes in
            your React components. It replaces the need for a CSS-in-JS library
            like Emotion or Styled Components and{" "}
            <strong>is compatible with RSC</strong>. Windstitch has a
            styled-like API and supports polymorphic components.

          To improve the DX of Windstitch, this template also includes a custom
          VS Code <code>settings.json</code> file. This extension allows you to
          use Tailwind classes in your CSS-in-JS files and provides
          autocompletion for them. It is not perfect yet, but it is still a
          great improvement over the default experience.

            Turbopack is a build tool developed by Vercel that is written in
            Rust. It replaces the need for a bundler like Webpack or Parcel and{" "}
            <strong>is extremely fast</strong>. You should therefore notice a
            significant improvement in your build times.

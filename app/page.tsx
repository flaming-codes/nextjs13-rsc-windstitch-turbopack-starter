              This is a template to get you started with Next.js 13, RSC (React
              Server Components), Windstitch (Tailwind CSS in React), and
              Turbopack. It uses colaction to organize your code (see{" "}
              <code>/modules</code>) and uses as much new features from Next.js
              13 as possible.

              Next.js 13 introduces a new <code>/app</code> directory that is
              intended to contain all routes as well as meta data, layout
              definitions, and other colocated files. This is a great way to
              organize your application and is a big improvement over the
              previous approach.

              With Next.js 13, you can now revalidate React (Server) components
              by simply adding a<code>revalidate</code> property as 2nd argument
              to the <code>fetch</code> function inside the RSC.

              Windstitch is a library that allows you to use Tailwind classes in
              your React components. It replaces the need for a CSS-in-JS
              library like Emotion or Styled Components and{" "}
              <strong>is compatible with RSC</strong>. Windstitch has a
              styled-like API and supports polymorphic components.

          >
            To improve the DX of Windstitch, this template also includes a
            custom VS Code <code>settings.json</code> file. This extension
            allows you to use Tailwind classes in your CSS-in-JS files and
            provides autocompletion for them. It is not perfect yet, but it is
            still a great improvement over the default experience.

              Turbopack is a build tool developed by Vercel that is written in
              Rust. It replaces the need for a bundler like Webpack or Parcel
              and <strong>is extremely fast</strong>. You should therefore
              notice a significant improvement in your build times.

              This template also uses TypeScript 5. TypeScript 5 introduces
